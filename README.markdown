# TEC(Costa Rica Institute of Technology) M.Sc. Thesis in Latex

This is a [Latex](http://www.latex-project.org/) template for a M.Sc. thesis at TEC(http://www.tec.ac.cr). It 
tries to conform to the standards requested by the Computer Science School (2011).

This project borrow some ideas from [kljensen thesis repository](https://github.com/kljensen/mit-phd-thesis).

This project is easily managed from TexShop for Mac. It includes configuration to simplify typesetting the
individual files without having to go to the main.tex.
