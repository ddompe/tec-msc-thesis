Embedded Systems are one of the fastest growing markets in the computer industry, but the discipline of embedded software development is still young; best practices common on other software development areas aren't encouraged by the market dynamics, product development cycles and the requirements of low-level integration with the hardware.  Furthermore embedded developers tend to shy away from existing frameworks that may improve re-usability when they can't meet their performance goals. This is particularly true for multimedia systems, where the amounts of data processing may easily impose severe overhead in an embedded architecture.
All these factors lead to low re-usability of the software written for embedded systems.
This work addresses the problem of improving multimedia software stacks for embedded systems, focusing on the GStreamer multimedia framework with the Linux operating system. The
