\chapter{Objectives and Contributions}
\section{Objectives}
Focus on the benefits of your study not the research problem.
Place yourself in the position of responding to someone who says “so what?” Provide a persuasive rationale for your argument by answering the following questions: Why is your study important? To whom is it important? What can happen to society, or theory, or a program if the study is done or not done?

\subsection{Purpose}
Begin with “The purpose of this study is to…” change, interpret, understand, evaluate, or analyze the problem.
State your thesis goal completely. Remember, it should be some form of investigative activity.

\section{Previous work}

\subsection{Literature review}
Locate and briefly describe those studies and theories that support and oppose your approach to the problem. In other words, place the proposed study in context through a critical analysis of selected research reports.
Be sure to include alternative methodological approaches that have been used by others who studied your problem.
