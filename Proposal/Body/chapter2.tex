\chapter{Objectives and Contributions}

\section{General Objective}

\begin{itemize}
\item Design a software architecture to integrate algorithms based on the CodecEngine framework into the GStreamer multimedia framework, taking in consideration existing knowledge regarding efficient implementation and software maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Objective 1
\item Specific Objective 2
\end{itemize}

\section{Contributions to the subject}
This work will provide documentation regarding the details of the specific tradeoffs for the implementation approaches of multimedia software on the target platforms, and will serve as basics for future work regarding improving performance (power consumption).

\section{Scope and Limitations}
We will provide a reference implementation working on at least two different platforms. The reference implementation may lack features compared with existing solutions, but focused on providing a more maintainable design and performance equal or better.
